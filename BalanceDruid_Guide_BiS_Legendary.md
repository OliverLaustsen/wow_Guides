> As seen on the timeline the new moon hits right @ pull 

## 2. Rotation
    * l Maintain Emerald Dreamcatcher @ 2 stacks
        * With your haste rating you should have around 80% uptime
        * It is important to recognize when you cant keep it up and then prepare for a long period with the uptime by getting close to AP cap and Starsurge when the first stack is about to run out for extended duration (see below)
    * Don't overcap on AP (Astral Power) - Worth more than a empowerment buff
    * @ 2 charges of Moon spells try getting 2 Starsurges in
    * Alternate between casting Solar Wrath and Lunar Strike (Always priortize the spell closest to 3 stacks of empowerment)
    * Reapply dots if need be (shouldn't be need more then 3 times during an entire fight)

>The cast between the second Solar Wrath and the following Starsurge is delayed as he cannot

    * Track your AP with a custom Power Bar(Uezo - WA) for highlighting when Starsurge is available 
    * When useing Blessing of the Acients always stay in Blessing of Elune
    * Prepare your AP for doing tacts - so you can cast on the move (Less down time)
      Ideally you should have +70 AP when about to soak a cake for instance
